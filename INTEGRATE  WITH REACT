Step 1: Install React + Vite
You can do that with the following command:

npm create vite@latest my-website-critic -- --template react
Step 2: Install OpenAI Node package
Open the generated project folder in your favorite IDE and install the OpenAI Node package, which you will use to interact with the GPT4 Vision model.

Here's how to install it:

cd my-website-critic
npm install openai
Step 3: Install the React markdown package
This will help you format the model's textual responses in a readable format.

npm install react-markdown
Step 4: Run npm install
Now run npm install:

  npm install
  npm run dev
Step 5: Manage state in React
In this step, you will use React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing the state and handling the asynchronous request to OpenAI's API in src/App.jsx.
